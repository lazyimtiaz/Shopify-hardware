    <p class="section-intro">For over three decades, our team has helped local builders, farmers, and homeowners find the right hardware for jobs that need to hold up year after year.</p>
    <p>We started as a neighborhood supply counter and grew through trust—earned by stocking reliable brands, giving straight answers, and standing behind every recommendation. Today, we combine that same hands-on expertise with online convenience, so you can source quality hardware quickly without sacrificing confidence.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re framing a home, replacing gate hinges, or rebuilding equipment in the workshop, we’re here with products selected for real use, not short-term fixes.</p>
